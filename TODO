- more & better unit testing!!! (>90% coverage would be nice too)
- refactor rpa/base.rb and document it, esp. LocalInstallation.
- begin to think about the RPA policy
- 90% done: throw away the scripts in bin/ and write real tools
  (the equivalent of dpkg -s, apt-get (update|install|remove), an
  über-apt-cache search and a way to rollback transactions that were not
  completed due to a *crash*, a kind of apt-get -f install)
- work through the missing user stories
