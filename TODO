- signed packages/ports
- extend the 'package cache' concept to make it work remotely (binary repos)
- system-wide conf system with several frontends
- ask for confirmation before installing deps, etc
- ports should specify which archs. they can be built on; packages, which
  archs they can be installed under
- more & better unit testing!!! (>90% coverage would be nice too)
- refactor rpa/base.rb and document it, esp. LocalInstallation.
- begin to think about the RPA policy
- 90% done: throw away the scripts in bin/ and write real tools
  (the equivalent of dpkg -s, apt-get (update|install|remove), an
  über-apt-cache search and a way to rollback transactions that were not
  completed due to a *crash*, a kind of apt-get -f install)
- work through the missing user stories
